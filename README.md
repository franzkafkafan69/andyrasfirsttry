<h1 style="color:Tomato;">All about Ace Trappola</h1>
<h2 style="color:Gray;">" A quick learner with an upbeat personality and a mischievous streak. Since he and Deuce are both Heartslabyul freshmen in the same class, they regard one another with amicable antagonism. "</h2>
<h2> Appearance </h2>
<p> Ace is a fair-skinned young man of average height. He has fluffy, orange hair that flips up at the ends, and average-length bangs that fall around his face and between his eyes. His eyes are bright scarlet in color, and over his left eye is a red marking shaped like a heart. He is often seen showing off an energetic smile.</p>
